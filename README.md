# Wedoo

Wedoo is a shared habit tracker that makes building routines social and fun. Instead of checking boxes alone, you and your friends take care of a bear—staying consistent keeps it happy, skipping habits makes it sad.

## Features
- Shared habit tracking with friends
- AI task suggestions + custom tasks
- Photo proof for completions
- Bear reactions based on group performance
- Friend nudges + progress visibility

## Why
Most habit apps feel lonely and boring. Wedoo adds accountability, emotion, and connection so habits actually stick.

## Tech Stack
- React Native / Expo
- Supabase (auth + data)
- Gemini API (task suggestions)
- Figma (UI/UX)
- Git/GitHub (collaboration)

## Challenges
Balancing playful design with real utility, creating supportive social features, and handling real-time shared state cleanly.

## Accomplishments
First mobile app for our team, fully functional + cohesive design, and a character-driven experience that reinforces accountability.

## What’s Next
More animations, richer bear personality, stronger group interactions, and expanded community use.
